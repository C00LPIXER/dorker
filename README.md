# Dorker

**Dorker** is a web-based tool designed to help cybersecurity researchers and developers identify vulnerabilities in their domains using Google Dorking (Google Hacking) techniques. The tool simplifies the process of applying Google dorks to target URLs, enabling efficient identification of sensitive data or security flaws exposed on the web.

## Features

- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Add a target domain and select from various Google dorks.
- **Google Dorking Integration**: Automatically perform Google dork searches tailored to find specific vulnerabilities.
- **Learn & Explore**: A resource for researchers and developers to understand and experiment with Google Dorking techniques.

## Getting Started

1. Visit the website:  [dorker](https://dorker.vercel.app/)

2. **Add your target URL**: Input the URL of the website or domain you want to scan.

3. **Select Google Dorks**: Choose from a variety of predefined Google dorks.

4. **Run the scan**: Click the button to initiate the dorking search.

5. **Review the Results**: Analyze the output for any vulnerabilities or sensitive data discovered.

## How It Works

- **Dorker** uses Googleâ€™s search engine to look for specific patterns, which may indicate vulnerabilities in your target domain.
- Each dork is designed to find a specific type of exposed information such as login forms, file directories, or misconfigured servers.
